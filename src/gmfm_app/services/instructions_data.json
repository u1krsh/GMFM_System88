This is definitely acceptable for this item provided they touch the toy with the right hand. Older children may simply be asked to turn and touch the toy with their right hand. Typically, it is more difficult with younger children. The therapist may try passing the toy along the right side to gain their attention and then stopping at the appropriate position, anticipating that the child will attempt to reach for it. It is important to keep their attention on the toy. For a score of 2, “reaches behind”, the hand must reach beyond the greater trochanter."

To obtain a score of 1, place the child on the mat half kneeling on the left knee holding on to the bench. Any child who cannot maintain high kneeling at the bench cannot be tested for this item and would receive a score of zero.",
    "instructions": "This item may require a few “test trials” to determine whether or not the child will assume half kneeling on the left knee from high kneeling and whether or not the bench will be used. The three trials for scoring may then begin. (Review “high kneeling” in the Explanation of Terms.) Half kneeling indicates that the weight is taken on one knee and the opposite foot. Alignment is not critical as long as the buttocks are clear of the lower leg and/or the mat. To obtain a score of 3, instruct the child to assume half kneeling on the left knee, using arms. (Review “using arms” in the Explanation of Terms.) Assuming half kneeling without using the arms for assistance is also acceptable. Once half kneeling has been assumed, ask the child to maintain arms free, 10 seconds. (Review “arms free” in Explanation of Terms.) To obtain a score of 2, instruct the child to assume half kneeling on the left knee holding on to bench for support or balance with one or both hands. Once half kneeling has been assumed, ask the child to maintain the position for 10 seconds. Continuing to hold on to the bench during the 10 seconds, either with one or both hands is acceptable. However, any use of the bench in assuming or maintaining half kneeling restricts the child to a score of 2 or less. To obtain a score of 1, instruct the child to maintain half kneeling on the left knee for 10 seconds while holding on to the bench with one or both hands. For each of these scores the 10 second time requirement must be achieved in order for them to be credited with any score. Many children use half kneeling only in transition to standing (if they use it at all!). The use of toys as a distraction on the bench may assist with achieving the time requirement."

This does not include holding on to a person. If a particular piece of equipment is used it is advisable to note this in the Comments section of the score sheet and replicate this on subsequent testing. For a score of 3 the child must be positioned in high kneeling, arms free. (Review “arms free” in the Explanation of Terms.) The child must be able to maintain high kneeling holding on with two hands to attempt this item.",
    "instructions": "Instruct children to walk forward on their knees at least 10 steps. One step forward includes the movement of one leg from “push off” to floor contact. Note that for each of the three possible scores, 10 steps forward must be taken. Several “test trials” may be needed to determine whether or not the child needs to be holding on to equipment, whether or not one or two hands will be used, and, if necessary, which equipment is best for the child to hold on to. It may also be necessary to test what surface is best for the child to kneel walk on, and whether the equipment will move forward easily. STANDING This dimension includes 13 items that deal with various aspects of standing. These include the child’s ability to: • maintain various standing positions • assume standing from various positions • perform specific tasks from the standing position."

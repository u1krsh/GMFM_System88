# GMFM Companion

Offline-first GMFM-66/88 scoring companion for clinicians. Ships with a KivyMD UI, encrypted SQLite storage, PDF summaries, and charting utilities.

## Features (MVP)
- Accurate, testable GMFM-66 and GMFM-88 scoring pipeline.
- Offline-first patient/session management backed by SQLite.
- Field-level encryption for sensitive patient identifiers.
- Clean, touch-friendly UI built with KivyMD.
- PDF exports with per-domain score breakdowns and sparkline trend charts.

## Security
- Encryption keys resolved from `GMFM_APP_SECRET`, OS keyring, or generated `.env.local` fallback.
- Patient names and identifiers are encrypted at rest inside SQLite.
- Local filesystem folders (`reports/`, `exports/`) are created on launch; protect them with OS-level encryption for production.

## Getting Started
1. **Create and activate** a Python 3.11+ environment.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```
3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   python -m gmfm_app.app
   ```
4. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
   ```

## Using the App
1. Launch the Kivy UI and create a patient from the toolbar.
2. Record a GMFM-66 or GMFM-88 session by entering scores as `item:score` pairs (e.g., `1:3,2:2`).
3. Open a patient's sessions to view trend charts (total + per-domain) and export a one-page PDF.
4. Generated artifacts:
   - Charts saved to `exports/patient_<id>_trend.png`.
   - PDF reports saved to `reports/patient_<id>_session_<id>.pdf`.

> The UI uses Kivy; make sure you have the required system dependencies per the [Kivy installation guide](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation.html).

## Repository Layout
- `src/gmfm_app/` – application source
- `tests/` – pytest-based automated tests
- `docs/` – architecture and planning documents

## Roadmap
- Remote sync adapter
- Role-based access control
- Automated deployment bundles (Windows/macOS)
